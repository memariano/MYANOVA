Without prior knowledge of what H10 consulting deliverables consist of it is difficult to provide specifics on what the consulting practice should look like. Iâ€™m assuming that the primary goals are: Help clients understand the potential benefits of using ML in their businesses. Help clients understand how we can help them achieve those benefits. Conduct projects with and or for them. Teach them business improvement with ML?

Consulting Leadership Responsibilities

Employees tend to preform better and contractors are more expendable during downturns. Consultant development Teach the H10 approach to consulting. Teach H10 intellectual property. Train consultants on delivery techniques and expectations. Mentor, evaluate and provide feedback to consultants. Intellectual property development Charts/slides/forms etc. to be used with and for clients. Sales and marketing materials as related to the consulting business.
